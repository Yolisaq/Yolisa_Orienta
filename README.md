- **Portrait upside down (angle 180):** Timer (set minutes/seconds; start/pause/reset)
- **Landscape left (angle 270):** Weather of the Day (Open‑Meteo; geolocation with Johannesburg fallback)

## Run locally
1. Download `index.html` and open it in a **mobile browser** (Android Chrome / iOS Safari). It also works in desktop with DevTools device toolbar.

# Orienta — One‑Page Orientation Web App 🚀📱

**Features mapped to device orientation**

- **📌 Portrait (upright, angle 0):** Alarm Clock (set/clear/snooze 5m)
- **⏱️ Landscape right (angle 90):** Stopwatch (start/pause/reset)
- **⏲️ Portrait upside down (angle 180):** Timer (set minutes/seconds; start/pause/reset)
- **🌤️ Landscape left (angle 270):** Weather of the Day (Open‑Meteo; geolocation with Johannesburg fallback)

## Project Status ✅
- **🟢 Completed:** All four orientation-based features fully implemented.
- **📱 Tested on:** Android Chrome, iOS Safari, Desktop Chrome (device emulator).
- **⚠️ Known issues:** On some iOS devices, upside-down orientation may be disabled by system settings; Safari supports it.
- **💡 Next steps:** Could add custom themes, notifications, or more precise alarm vibration patterns.

## Run locally 🖥️📲
1. Download `index.html` and open it in a **mobile browser** (Android Chrome / iOS Safari). Works on desktop with DevTools device toolbar too.

## Tech notes
- Runs 100% in the browser (no backend).
- Orientation detection uses `screen.orientation.angle`, `window.orientation` (iOS fallback), and a resize fallback.
- Weather: [Open‑Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) — free, no API key. We request `current_weather` and daily high/low.
- Works on Android and iOS. On iOS, upside‑down may be disabled by system in some apps, but Safari allows it.
